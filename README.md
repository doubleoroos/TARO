# TARO
Taro app
Project Statement/Goal

My project is an app that helps you stay focused on your happiness and “purpose” in life. My app is only made out one or two pages for the time
being. Tarot cards are my prior works, the artifacts or objects that I will “remix” as part of my project. Let me explain. Tarot is a card game with
the structure of a standard card game with which you can play bridge and Belote, with 22 trump cards and one extra court card added. Tarot is
mainly known today as a tool to look into the future. But Tarot started out as a regular card game. In parts of Italy, for example, the Tarot is still
played in the original state. My Tarot game contains only two cards for starters, one for the past the other one for the future. When the player
clicks on the play button, the cards switch. That is the secret, the so-called oracle moment. My project's conceptual underpinnings are whenever
you play tarot, you will get some sort of divine guidance. Giving mental support to the player is my project’s theme.

Motivation
I am doing this project because I am passionate about changing the world. I am not saying my app will change the world, it will get some people
entertainment and that’s a start. I am investigating app building with Xcode and people’s mental state and behavior especially now during
lockdown. How, why and what, are my research questions. I am exploring the way I can build this app and the effect of my tarot cards as an
archetype for the player to explore and become more in depth with. Research, research, research is the prior work I have done that for me
provides evidence that I can complete this project. I already started coding and designing.
I think I can manage in 3 weeks.
Research Review

This site https://fineartamerica.com/art/tarot has influenced my project and see my blog https://www.doubleoroos.org/nyu-study-blog The
evolution of tarot is my research that I am incorporating into my project. See The Art of Tarot

Target Audience
My project is for nerds. I created a detailed buyer Persona see the link below. My insights I gathered from the existing customer base. You can
add data from market research to make it more meaningful. This is my target audience and my target users https://www.doubleoroos.org/nyustudy-
blog/integrated-digital-media-capstone-research- I want my target audience to experience a feeling of happiness bliss, while using my app.

Resources
All apps for magical answers are my resources, tools, and technologies. What I have seen is all 8balls apps are kind of lame. I want to do something different with the
interface. Something that amazes. In the field of educational technology, my app needs to be way smart. More and more apps are delivering on-demand help to people,
who can easily re-purpose the learning tools to obtain not just assistance, but also answers. I need to deliver mine original and fun. My competition is humongous.
My example and source of inspiration remix thingy is
Gris by Devolver & Nomada Studio (double click for the YouTube video)
This is so beautiful. Gris is a visually arresting platformer-puzzle game about a woman exploring the world after losing her voice. It’s short — you can finish the game in a
few hours — but once you’re done, you’ll be glad you experienced developer Nomada Studio’s artistic endeavor, one that will tug at your heartstrings and amaze you
with its wordless storytelling.

Design / Aesthetic Ideas
My app interface is my ideation processes to conceptualize my project. The research processes shaped my ideas.

Project Milestones
Partnering with nonprofit organization, every time someone buys my app I will donate 50% to that nonprofit organization (Greenpeace). My inspiration for the game
came from nature so obviously I will give some of my earnings to a mature orientated non profit organization. First, I need to get the job done!
